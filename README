zram for Fedora
===============

zram compresses swap partitions into RAM for performance.

You need Linux kernel version 2.6.37.1 or better to use 
zram.

There are 3 files you need to enable zram for Fedora. They
are:

	- zramstart
	- zramstop
	- zram.service

All these files can be found in the project folder.

Place "zramstart" and "zramstop" in the following folder.

	/usr/local/sbin

Place "zram.service" in the following folder.

	/etc/systemd/system

Place "zram" in the following folder.

	/etc/default

As root, run the following command to enable zram for
Fedora.

	systemctl daemon-reload
	systemctl enable zram.service
	systemctl start zram.service

Run the following command to make sure the service started
properly.

	systemctl status zram.service

The output should look like this.

zram.service - Enable compressed swap in memory using zram
		Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zram.service; enabled)
		Active: active (exited) since Sun, 02 Oct 2011 22:46:31 -0400; 44min ago
		Process: 942 ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/zramstart (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
		CGroup: name=systemd:/system/zram.service

That's it!
